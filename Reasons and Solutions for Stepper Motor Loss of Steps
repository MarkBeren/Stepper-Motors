Reasons why stepper motor loses steps
1. Unstable power supply: The motor requires a stable power supply to operate. If the power supply is unstable, the motor will have insufficient driving capability, causing it to lose steps or fail to work properly.
2. Transmission component failure: If there is a problem with any link in the stepper motor transmission chain, it will usually lead to instability of the entire transmission system. For example, belt aging, looseness, excessive guide rail friction, and mechanical structural problems.
3. Signal interference: The stepper motor needs to receive external signals to work. If the external interface encounters signal interference, the step signal will be lost, causing the motor to lose steps.
4. Excessive rotational inertia: The load of the stepper motor has a great impact. If the inertia is too large, it will increase the load on the motor, causing the motor to lose steps.
Solution to stepper motor losing steps
1. Check the power supply: Check whether the power supply is stable. You can test it with a voltmeter and other tools. If the voltage measurement results are unstable, you need to replace the power supply with a more stable one or install a voltage stabilizer.
2. Check the transmission components: Check whether each link of the transmission chain is normal. If any problems are found, replace them in time. In addition, the belt tension and guide rail lubrication should also be checked.
3. Reduce signal interference: Avoid the stepper motor working with other electrical equipment at the same time, or change the working position of the motor. Professional electromagnetic shielding equipment can also be used to reduce interference from external signals.
4. Reduce the load: A shock absorbing device can be installed on the motor shaft to reduce the impact of the load on the motor. You can also choose methods to reduce the load, such as reducing the load range of the motor's operation, or replacing the motor with a more powerful one.
To sum up, the stepper motor losing steps may not be a problem with the motor itself, but a transmission problem caused by external factors. By identifying the problem and taking appropriate measures in a timely manner, the stepper motor can be made to work again and improve efficiency. In order to reduce the loss of steps as much as possible, it is recommended to pay attention to maintenance and maintenance when using stepper motors, and take protective measures to avoid problems such as excessive load.
